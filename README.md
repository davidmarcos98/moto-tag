After prying enough of the edge, you can use a sharp hobby knife (be careful) to separate the speaker layer as shown in the next picture. It's glued down, but it's soft glue. If you have any trouble, try slightly heating it up with a hair dryer. Be careful with the knife, as below this layer is the PCB uncovered.
